<h1 align="center"> Welcome to the Quiz-Point project! </h1>

***This application is being developed as a Spring Boot learning project, in which we'll be diving into several components of the Spring family.***

***The idea of the application is simple, it's a quiz application in which users can create and publish quizzes. Other users can then play those quizzes. To make the application a bit more interesting, it also includes a user management module with functionality such as email sign up, login or forgot my password. It then uses Spring Security for authentication and authorization purposes. Users are required to open an account in order to create and edit their own quizzes, but they can play without the need for an account. In addition, users can save their quizzes as drafts and publish them later on, provided the quiz is well formed at the time of publishing.***

***This is intended to be a learning project so please, feel free to fork this repository and play around with the code!***
